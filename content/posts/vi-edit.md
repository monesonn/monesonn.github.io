When it comes to editing files, I would definitely recommended any VI-like editors [Vim/Neovim]. They are pretty simple and functional as the Swiss knife. They can be used directly from the terminal and compared to other editors, they more faster and better cope with different types of files. The mastering itself, I would describe the Bushnell Citation: "Easy to learn, hard on the master." Knowledge of it will never be superfluous and only depends on you how useful it can be.

VI-like editors family:

- **[Vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/)** was the first screen-oriented text editor created for Unix, it was designed to be simple yet powerful for text manipulation.
- **[Vim (Vi IMproved)](https://github.com/vim/vim)** as its name suggests, is a clone of Vi and offers yet more features than Vi. Itâ€™s free and open source, designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface (GUI).
- **[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)** is a fork of Vim aiming to improve user experience, plugins, and GUIs. So, it's fully Vim-compatible editor. **[most preferred]**

VI-like editors is highly configurable and comes with notable features such as syntax highlighting, mouse support, graphical versions, visual mode, many new editing commands and a large amount of extension plus much more.

Below, as usual, I will leave useful links, and also cheatsheet:

## Tabs
