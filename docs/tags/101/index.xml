      <description>When it comes to editing files, I would definitely recommended any VI-like editors [Vim/Neovim]. They are pretty simple and functional as the Swiss knife. They can be used directly from the terminal and compared to other editors, they more faster and better cope with different types of files. The mastering itself, I would describe the Bushnell Citation: &amp;ldquo;Easy to learn, hard on the master.&amp;rdquo; Knowledge of it will never be superfluous and only depends on you how useful it can be.</description>

      <description>Not so long ago I faced the problem that it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult for me as a student to make presentations quickly and with high quality. Using Google Slide or similar services was not the best solution for me. For now, I won&amp;rsquo;t explain it yet.
So, alternatively, I started to use: Pandoc + Beamer bundle.
 Pandoc is a free and open-source document converter written on Haskell. Beamer is a LaTeX document class for creating presentation slides, with a wide range of templates and a set of features for making slideshow effects.</description>
